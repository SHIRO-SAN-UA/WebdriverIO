<!-- ### How to run tests

For reference use [Playwright Docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests)

1.  To run locally run `npx playwright test`.
1.  To generate and open Allure report in your browser run `npx allure serve allure-results`.
1.  Run `npx allure open` to view Allure report.


### Structure

-   `playwright.config.ts` file is the place where you can configure the playwright library. You can configure timeouts, parallelism, retires, and reporters, projects, etc. Playwright supports tons of customization and adjustment to meet your test suiteâ€™s requirements.
-   `tests` folder with tests
-   `pages` - forder with pages

### Standards

All test cases should be coded inside the `tests` folder.
Project build using [Page Object Model](https://playwright.dev/docs/pom). The main idea is to encapsulate logic into page classes and use the logic in the spec files to run the tests.

For instance we define the class LoginPage with locators and elements and reuse them in the code. -->
